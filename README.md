# Machine-Learning-Models
Machine Learning models ranging from basic to advanced.
The first model is a simple classification model, classifying which photos contain either rice or chips. It utilises an ensemble of algorithms and combines them with a voting classifier.
The second model is an unsupervised learning task. It clusters the dishes and then utilises cosine simlarity of ingredient vectors to return dish recommendations to the user.
