# Two Machine Learning Pipelines
Two traditional Machine Learning pipelines for varied tasks.
The first model is a simple classification model, classifying which photos contain either rice or chips. It utilises an ensemble of machine learning algorithms and combines them with a voting classifier.
The second model has an unsupervised learning focus. It clusters the dishes and then utilises cosine simlarity of ingredient vectors to return dish recommendations to the user.
